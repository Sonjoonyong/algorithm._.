# algorithm._.
An algorithm so complex and tough,
It boggles my mind, it's more than enough.
My brain it hurts, I can’t keep pace,
It’s a mathematical maze, a digital race.

I’m lost in the code, a sea of numbers and signs,
It’s a never-ending quest, a test of my mind.
But I’ll keep trying, I’ll not give up the fight,
For in this challenge, I see a path to light.
